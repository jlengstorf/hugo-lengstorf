  If you’re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don’t think you can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can’t believe I didn’t start living this life sooner.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I’ve put together a <a href="https://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/">free step-by-step guide</a> to show you how.</strong>

  Adulting is <em>hard</em>.
</p>
<p>
  We’re supposed to build careers, build relationships, build futures, build happiness&hellip; It’s all pretty fucking overwhelming. It’s easy to feel stuck — like we’re on autopilot, punching a clock, and buried in tasks we don’t really care about.
</p>
<p>
  Wouldn’t it be nice to get some balance back? To have extra time <em>every day</em> to dedicate to the things that are most important to you?
</p>
<p>
  I want to help: <strong>I’ve compiled <em>5 Habits of the Unfuckwithably Productive</em>, and <a href="{{ "/productivity-habits/" | absURL }}">I want to give it to you for free</a>.</strong> These are time-tested habits that power my successful career; this is <em>how I spend less than 40 hours a week on the computer — while making a living and traveling the world.</em>
